# WALWAL DRINKING CARDS
### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/SYUa9kp65u4>

### Description:
This project was created for the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science course
by Harvard University,yes
it is a drinking card game that gets random fun item from the database,
where you can also add your own card for personalization.

I made this app because me and my friends can't afford walwal cards
when we are drinking and we thought it would be a very good idea to
just make our own, with our personalized terms and phrases.

At first I was struggling to make the framework or what language i would use.
I first planned to use java because it would be an andriod application but
i have no idea how to code in java and I tried reading
documentations but it was hard so I  just use flask because on week 9 we focused
on it so I had experience how to use it so it
just became so easy and fun.

Coding was hard, especilly when you don't have good quality laptop and your internet
is not that good, but thanks to diferent websites,
google, quora, and stackoverflow, whenever I feel frustrated about something that doesn't work as I want to,
they helped me so much.

During the making of this app, looking back to past lectures and notes helped me a lot especially on flask and sql.

One of the bugs i have encountered was when I sumbit to add the title and item to the database, the id just makes it random that it makes a table row bofore it with do data so when it random get the title and item, it doesn't print something. What i did to fix that bug was to put Null as the value of id instead of neglecting it and it adds the item and title to the preceding last id.

Making also the items and the title was very fun because they were the games that i want to play with my friends.

The site was built using Flask (Python), SQLite3 for the database, CSS preprocessor (SASS) and javascript. I made the codes to upload photos after change the image name, hash all passwords, an administration page that permits add, remove and update schools, used advanced SQL queries to calculate users points, and much more.

It was very interesting to create this project from scratch using Flask and I used a lot of new resources for me, which I had never worked with before. I spent a lot of time studying and testing before implementing the code. All references to the pages I used as a support are commented on in the code.

I learned a lot from this project, and I was very happy with the result.
